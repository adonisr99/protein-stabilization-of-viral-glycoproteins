# Experiment Ideas

## Overview

This experimental program tests four core hypotheses that challenge fundamental assumptions in viral glycoprotein stabilization. Each experiment is designed following Computer Science-inspired research methodology with clear assumption → hypothesis → validation pathways. The experiments are computationally tractable and suitable for AI agent execution.

## Core Experimental Strategy

Our approach systematically validates each literature-level assumption flip through:
1. **Computational screening** using molecular dynamics and free energy calculations
2. **High-throughput mutational analysis** beyond traditional proline substitutions  
3. **Functional characterization** of stability vs. immunogenicity relationships
4. **Cross-variant validation** of proposed stabilization frameworks
