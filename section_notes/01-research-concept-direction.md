# Research Concept & Direction

## Core Research Problem

Develop novel stabilization strategies for viral glycoproteins that challenge fundamental assumptions in current prefusion stabilization approaches, specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and other coronavirus glycoproteins for improved vaccine immunogenicity.

## Literature-Level Assumptions Identified

Current literature makes several key assumptions that present opportunities for impactful research:

### Assumption 1: Proline-Centric Stabilization Paradigm
**What the field assumes**: Proline substitutions (particularly 2P mutations at K986P/V987P) are the gold standard for prefusion stabilization of coronavirus spike proteins. This approach is used across major COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, J&J, Novavax).

**Why this may be limiting**: Over-reliance on proline substitutions may miss other stabilization mechanisms and could introduce rigidity that affects antigenicity or limits conformational flexibility needed for optimal immune recognition.

### Assumption 2: Uniform Stabilization Strategies Across Variants
**What the field assumes**: Stabilization strategies developed for ancestral SARS-CoV-2 can be directly applied to emerging variants with minimal modification.

**Why this may be limiting**: Different variants may have distinct destabilizing mutations that require variant-specific stabilization approaches rather than one-size-fits-all solutions.

### Assumption 3: Prefusion State Maximization
**What the field assumes**: Maximum stabilization of the prefusion conformation always correlates with optimal immunogenicity and vaccine effectiveness.

**Why this may be limiting**: Over-stabilization might reduce the dynamic conformational sampling necessary for presenting diverse epitopes to the immune system.

### Assumption 4: Single-Target Stabilization
**What the field assumes**: Focusing stabilization efforts on individual spike proteins or domains (RBD, NTD) in isolation is sufficient.

**Why this may be limiting**: Inter-domain and inter-subunit cooperativity effects may be critical for achieving stable, immunogenic conformations.

### Assumption 5: Disulfide Bond-Independent Stabilization
**What the field assumes**: Protein stabilization can be achieved effectively without introducing engineered disulfide bonds, relying primarily on backbone modifications and cavity-filling mutations.

**Why this may be limiting**: Strategic disulfide bridge engineering has proven highly effective for other viral fusion proteins (influenza HA, RSV F) but remains underexplored for coronavirus stabilization.

### Assumption 6: Membrane-Proximal Region Independence
**What the field assumes**: Stabilization of the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) and transmembrane domain does not significantly impact prefusion stability or immunogenicity.

**Why this may be limiting**: Evidence from other fusion proteins suggests MPER conformational dynamics are critical for fusion mechanism and may be leveraged for enhanced stabilization.

### Assumption 7: pH-Temperature Insensitive Design
**What the field assumes**: Optimal stabilization strategies can be developed without considering pH and temperature sensitivity variations across different physiological and storage conditions.

**Why this may be limiting**: Recent studies show significant pH-temperature dependencies in spike protein stability that could inform more robust stabilization approaches.

### Assumption 8: Structural Homogenization Approach
**What the field assumes**: The most effective strategy is to maximize structural homogeneity and minimize conformational heterogeneity in prefusion state populations.

**Why this may be limiting**: Controlled structural heterogeneity within the prefusion ensemble might be necessary for optimal antigenicity and immune recognition.

### Assumption 9: Cleavage Site Agnostic Stabilization
**What the field assumes**: Furin cleavage site modifications (deletion/mutations) are sufficient alongside other stabilization approaches without considering deeper mechanistic integration.

**Why this may be limiting**: The interplay between cleavage site modifications and stabilization mutations may create synergistic or antagonistic effects not captured by independent approaches.

## Research Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Cavity-Filling Alternative to Proline Substitutions
**Prior work assumes**: Proline substitutions are the optimal approach for prefusion stabilization
**We propose**: Systematic cavity-filling mutations using hydrophobic residues can achieve superior stability while maintaining flexibility
**This matters because**: It could provide more stable immunogens without the conformational rigidity of prolines, potentially improving cross-variant immunity

### Hypothesis 2: Dynamic Stabilization Over Static Fixation
**Prior work assumes**: Maximum rigidity in prefusion state equals optimal immunogenicity
**We propose**: Controlled conformational dynamics within the prefusion state enhance immune recognition
**This matters because**: It could explain why some highly stabilized variants show reduced immunogenicity and guide design of next-generation vaccines

### Hypothesis 3: Cooperative Multi-Domain Stabilization
**Prior work assumes**: Stabilizing individual domains independently is sufficient
**We propose**: Engineering cooperative stabilization networks across multiple domains yields synergistic stability improvements
**This matters because**: It could achieve better stability with fewer mutations and maintain inter-domain communication critical for function

### Hypothesis 4: Variant-Specific Destabilization-Informed Design
**Prior work assumes**: Universal stabilization strategies work across all variants
**We propose**: Identifying variant-specific destabilization patterns enables targeted, more effective stabilization strategies
**This matters because**: It could provide a framework for rapidly adapting vaccine designs to emerging variants

### Hypothesis 5: Engineered Disulfide Cross-Linking Enhancement
**Prior work assumes**: Backbone modifications and proline substitutions are sufficient for optimal stabilization
**We propose**: Strategic inter-subunit disulfide bridge engineering provides superior stability while maintaining antigenicity
**This matters because**: It could establish a new paradigm for viral fusion protein stabilization with proven success in other systems

### Hypothesis 6: MPER-Integrated Stabilization Networks  
**Prior work assumes**: Membrane-proximal regions can be ignored in stabilization design
**We propose**: Incorporating MPER conformational constraints into stabilization strategies enhances overall prefusion stability
**This matters because**: It could unlock additional stabilization mechanisms and improve vaccine thermostability

### Hypothesis 7: pH-Temperature Adaptive Design
**Prior work assumes**: Stabilization strategies optimized at physiological conditions work universally
**We propose**: Multi-condition optimization across pH and temperature ranges yields more robust stabilized immunogens
**This matters because**: It could improve vaccine storage stability and efficacy under diverse environmental conditions

### Hypothesis 8: Controlled Ensemble Heterogeneity
**Prior work assumes**: Maximum structural homogenization equals optimal immunogenicity
**We propose**: Engineering controlled conformational diversity within the prefusion ensemble enhances immune recognition breadth
**This matters because**: It could reconcile stability requirements with antigenic diversity needs for broader protection

### Hypothesis 9: Cleavage-Stabilization Synergistic Design
**Prior work assumes**: Cleavage site and stabilization mutations act independently
**We propose**: Systematic optimization of cleavage site modifications in conjunction with stabilization mutations yields synergistic improvements
**This matters because**: It could achieve better stability and processability with fewer total mutations

## Research Impact Assessment

**Scope of Impact**: These hypotheses challenge fundamental assumptions spanning multiple dimensions:
- **Technical**: Alternative stabilization mechanisms beyond proline substitutions (disulfide engineering, MPER integration)  
- **Theoretical**: Questioning static vs. dynamic stabilization models and structural homogenization paradigms
- **Practical**: Framework for variant-adapted and environment-robust vaccine design
- **Methodological**: Systems-level approach integrating multiple stabilization mechanisms
- **Environmental**: pH-temperature adaptive design for improved vaccine storage and efficacy

**Field Transformation Potential**: Success in validating these hypotheses could:
1. Establish multiple new design principles for viral glycoprotein vaccines beyond current proline-centric approaches
2. Provide superior immunogens with enhanced stability, broader variant coverage, and improved storage characteristics
3. Create generalizable frameworks applicable to other viral fusion proteins across different virus families
4. Challenge fundamental assumptions about optimal vaccine antigen design, from static to dynamic optimization paradigms
5. Enable rapid vaccine adaptation strategies for emerging viral variants through mechanistic understanding
6. Bridge structural biology insights with practical vaccine development requirements
