# Core Research Problem

Develop novel stabilization strategies for viral glycoproteins that challenge fundamental assumptions in current prefusion stabilization approaches, specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and other coronavirus glycoproteins for improved vaccine immunogenicity.

## Literature-Level Assumptions Identified

Current literature makes several key assumptions that present opportunities for impactful research:

### Assumption 1: Proline-Centric Stabilization Paradigm

**What the field assumes**: Proline substitutions (particularly 2P mutations at K986P/V987P) are the gold standard for prefusion stabilization of coronavirus spike proteins. This approach is used across major COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, J\&J, Novavax).

**Why this may be limiting**: Over-reliance on proline substitutions may miss other stabilization mechanisms and could introduce rigidity that affects antigenicity or limits conformational flexibility needed for optimal immune recognition.

### Assumption 2: Uniform Stabilization Strategies Across Variants

**What the field assumes**: Stabilization strategies developed for ancestral SARS-CoV-2 can be directly applied to emerging variants with minimal modification.

**Why this may be limiting**: Different variants may have distinct destabilizing mutations that require variant-specific stabilization approaches rather than one-size-fits-all solutions.

### Assumption 3: Prefusion State Maximization

**What the field assumes**: Maximum stabilization of the prefusion conformation always correlates with optimal immunogenicity and vaccine effectiveness.

**Why this may be limiting**: Over-stabilization might reduce the dynamic conformational sampling necessary for presenting diverse epitopes to the immune system.

### Assumption 4: Single-Target Stabilization

**What the field assumes**: Focusing stabilization efforts on individual spike proteins or domains (RBD, NTD) in isolation is sufficient.

**Why this may be limiting**: Inter-domain and inter-subunit cooperativity effects may be critical for achieving stable, immunogenic conformations.

## Research Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Cavity-Filling Alternative to Proline Substitutions

**Prior work assumes**: Proline substitutions are the optimal approach for prefusion stabilization
**We propose**: Systematic cavity-filling mutations using hydrophobic residues can achieve superior stability while maintaining flexibility
**This matters because**: It could provide more stable immunogens without the conformational rigidity of prolines, potentially improving cross-variant immunity

### Hypothesis 2: Dynamic Stabilization Over Static Fixation

**Prior work assumes**: Maximum rigidity in prefusion state equals optimal immunogenicity
**We propose**: Controlled conformational dynaabilization

**Prior work assumes**: Stabilizing individual domains independently is sufficient
**We propose**: Engineering cooperative stabilization networks across multiple domains yields synergistic stability improvements
**This matters because**: It could achieve better stability with fewer mutations and maintain inter-domain communication critical for function

### Hypothesis 4: Variant-Specific Destabilization-Informed Design

**Prior work assumes**: Universal stabilization strategies work across all variants
**We propose**: Identifying variant-specific destabilization patterns enables targeted, more effective stabilization strategies
**This matters because**: It could provide a framework for rapidly adapting vaccine designs to emerging variants

## Research Impact Assessment

**Scope of Impact**: These hypotheses challenge fundamental assumptions spanning multiple dimensions:

* **Technical**: Alternative to dominant proline-substitution paradigm
* **Theoretical**: Questioning static vs. dynamic stabilization models
* **Practical**: Framework for variant-adapted vaccine design
* **Methodological**: Systems-level approach to protein stabilization

**Field Transformation Potential**: Success in validating these hypotheses could:

1. Establish new design principles for viral glycoprotein vaccines
2. Provide superior immunogens for current and future coronavirus variants
3. Create generalizable frameworks applicable to other viral fusion proteins
4. Challenge the field's assumptions about optimal vaccine antigen design

## Next Steps

This research concept provides the foundation for systematic experimental validation through:

1. Computational screening of alternative stabilization strategies
2. High-throughput mutational analysis beyond proline substitutions
3. Functional characterization of stability vs. immunogenicity relationships
4. Cross-variant validation of proposed stabilization frameworks
