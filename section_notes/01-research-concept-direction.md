# Core Research Problem&#x20;

Develop novel stabilization strategies for viral glycoproteins that challenge fundamental assumptions in current prefusion stabilization approaches, specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and other coronavirus glycoproteins for improved vaccine immunogenicity.

**Research Philosophy**: Following the Computer Science-inspired methodology of assumption + hypothesis, we identify literature-level assumptions that span multiple papers and propose inversions that could reshape the entire field of viral glycoprotein vaccine design.

## Literature-Level Assumptions Identified&#x20;

Current literature makes several key assumptions that present opportunities for impactful research:

### Assumption 1: Proline-Centric Stabilization Paradigm

**What the field assumes**: Proline substitutions (particularly 2P mutations at K986P/V987P) are the gold standard for prefusion stabilization of coronavirus spike proteins. This approach is used across major COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, J\&J, Novavax).

**Why this may be limiting**: Over-reliance on proline substitutions may miss other stabilization mechanisms and could introduce rigidity that affects antigenicity or limits conformational flexibility needed for optimal immune recognition.

### Assumption 2: Uniform Stabilization Strategies Across Variants

**What the field assumes**: Stabilization strategies developed for ancestral SARS-CoV-2 can be directly applied to emerging variants with minimal modification.

**Why this may be limiting**: Different variants may have distinct destabilizing mutations that require variant-specific stabilization approaches rather than one-size-fits-all solutions.

### Assumption 3: Prefusion State Maximization

**What the field assumes**: Maximum stabilization of the prefusion conformation always correlates with optimal immunogenicity and vaccine effectiveness.

**Why this may be limiting**: Over-stabilization might reduce the dynamic conformational sampling necessary for presenting diverse epitopes to the immune system.

### Assumption 4: Single-Target Stabilization

**What the field assumes**: Focusing stabilization efforts on individual spike proteins or domains (RBD, NTD) in isolation is sufficient.

**Why this may be limiting**: Inter-domain and inter-subunit cooperativity effects may be critical for achieving stable, immunogenic conformations.

### Assumption 5: Thermal Stability as Primary Metric

**What the field assumes**: Thermal stability (melting temperature) is the most relevant metric for evaluating stabilization success and predicting vaccine performance.

**Why this may be limiting**: Thermal stability may not correlate with functional stability under physiological conditions, storage stability, or immunological presentation quality.

### Assumption 6: Post-Fusion State Avoidance

**What the field assumes**: Any transition toward post-fusion conformations is detrimental and should be completely eliminated through stabilization.

**Why this may be limiting**: Controlled exposure of post-fusion epitopes might enhance breadth of immune response and provide protection against escape variants.

### Assumption 7: Structure-Based Design Sufficiency

**What the field assumes**: High-resolution structural information provides sufficient guidance for rational stabilization design without requiring extensive experimental screening.

**Why this may be limiting**: Static structures may miss dynamic stabilization opportunities and allosteric effects that emerge from protein motion and conformational sampling.

## Research Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Cavity-Filling Alternative to Proline Substitutions

**Prior work assumes**: Proline substitutions are the optimal approach for prefusion stabilization
**We propose**: Systematic cavity-filling mutations using hydrophobic residues can achieve superior stability while maintaining flexibility
**This matters because**: It could provide more stable immunogens without the conformational rigidity of prolines, potentially improving cross-variant immunity

### Hypothesis 2: Dynamic Stabilization Over Static Fixation

**Prior work assumes**: Maximum rigidity in prefusion state equals optimal immunogenicity
**We propose**: Controlled conformational dynamics within the prefusion state enhance immune recognition
**This matters because**: It could explain why some highly stabilized variants show reduced immunogenicity and guide design of next-generation vaccines

### Hypothesis 3: Cooperative Multi-Domain Stabilization

**Prior work assumes**: Stabilizing individual domains independently is sufficient
**We propose**: Engineering cooperative stabilization networks across multiple domains yields synergistic stability improvements
**This matters because**: It could achieve better stability with fewer mutations and maintain inter-domain communication critical for function

### Hypothesis 4: Variant-Specific Destabilization-Informed Design

**Prior work assumes**: Universal stabilization strategies work across all variants
**We propose**: Identifying variant-specific destabilization patterns enables targeted, more effective stabilization strategies
**This matters because**: It could provide a framework for rapidly adapting vaccine designs to emerging variants

### Hypothesis 5: Functional Stability Over Thermal Stability

**Prior work assumes**: Thermal stability is the best predictor of vaccine antigen performance
**We propose**: Functional stability metrics (receptor binding retention, conformational integrity under physiological stress) better predict immunogenic success
**This matters because**: It could redirect stabilization efforts toward clinically relevant stability measures and improve vaccine efficacy predictions

### Hypothesis 6: Strategic Post-Fusion Exposure

**Prior work assumes**: Any post-fusion conformation exposure reduces vaccine effectiveness
**We propose**: Controlled, limited exposure of conserved post-fusion epitopes enhances breadth of immune response
**This matters because**: It could provide broader protection against variant escape and improve universal vaccine design

### Hypothesis 7: Dynamics-Informed Rational Design

**Prior work assumes**: Static high-resolution structures provide sufficient information for optimal stabilization design
**We propose**: Incorporating protein dynamics and allosteric networks into design algorithms yields superior stabilization strategies
**This matters because**: It could unlock stabilization approaches invisible to structure-only analysis and improve rational design success rates
