# Research Concept & Direction

The point of this project would be to apply different stabilization techniques for keeping a viral glycoprotein, like the SARS-coV-2 spike protein, in their pre-fusion state. This state is native on a viral surface and is more relevant for protective antibodies in vaccine responses .Long term, I want to create an immunogen of other coronavirus glycoproteins.
