## 6-Point Analysis

### Problem
- Spike protein exhibits substantial conformational flexibility complicating structural studies
- Need for stable, homogeneous spike preparations for research and diagnostic applications
- Current stabilization approaches insufficient for maintaining closed conformation

### Prior Assumptions
- Simple proline mutations sufficient for stabilization
- Open conformation necessary for immunogenicity
- Individual mutations work in isolation

### Insight
- **Key Finding**: Covalent crosslinking can trap spike in thermostable, closed conformation
- Closed conformation can be highly stable while retaining immunogenic properties
- Engineering approach enables production of homogeneous, well-defined conformational states

### Technical Approach
- Strategic covalent crosslinking to lock closed conformation
- Thermal stability assessment
- Structural characterization using cryo-EM
- Serological assay validation
- Comparison with non-crosslinked variants

### Evaluation
- Structural determination of crosslinked and non-crosslinked trimers
- Thermal stability measurements
- Functional validation in serological assays
- Identification of distinct closed conformations

### Impact
- **Supports Hypothesis 2**: Demonstrates that specific conformational states can be stabilized without compromising function
- **Provides tools for testing**: Static vs dynamic stabilization approaches
- **Challenges Assumption 3**: Shows closed conformation can be highly immunogenic
- Establishes covalent engineering as alternative to proline paradigm

## Relevance to Research Hypotheses

**Directly supports Hypothesis 2**: Provides tools to test static vs dynamic stabilization by creating covalently locked conformational states.

**Challenges Assumption 1**: Demonstrates successful alternative to proline-based stabilization through covalent engineering.
