## 6-Point Analysis

### Problem
- Spike protein thermodynamic metastability makes structural/biochemical studies challenging
- Existing stabilization approaches are empirical rather than systematic
- Need computational tools to identify optimal stabilizing mutations

### Prior Assumptions
- Structure-based rational design captures optimal stabilizing mutations
- Manual inspection of structures sufficient for mutation identification
- Empirical approaches adequate for finding stabilization strategies

### Insight
- **Key Finding**: Automated computational pipeline can systematically identify stabilizing mutations beyond human intuition
- Integration of multiple computational approaches (dynamics, conservation, structural analysis) superior to individual methods
- Motion dynamics from MD simulations reveal non-obvious stabilization targets

### Technical Approach
- Automated pipeline integrating:
  - Bioinformatics analysis of conserved residues
  - Molecular dynamics simulations for motion analysis
  - Structural analysis tools
  - Eris protein design tool for mutation prediction
- Validation against known prefusion spike mutants

### Evaluation
- Pipeline validated against known K986P/V987P mutations
- Identified novel prefusion stabilizing mutations
- Computational predictions matched experimental stabilization data

### Impact
- **Challenges Assumption 1**: Shows systematic computational approaches can identify effective alternatives to proline paradigm
- **Supports Hypothesis 5**: Validates high-throughput systematic screening superior to structure-based rational design alone
- Establishes framework for computational vaccine antigen optimization
- Enables rapid identification of stabilizing mutations for emerging variants

## Relevance to Research Hypotheses

**Directly supports Hypothesis 1**: Computational approach identifies cavity-filling and alternative stabilization mechanisms beyond proline substitutions.

**Validates Hypothesis 5**: Demonstrates that systematic screening (computational) reveals stabilizing mutations not apparent from structural analysis alone.
