## 6-Point Analysis

### Problem
- Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 variants evolved different spike protein dynamics
- Need to characterize conformational changes across variant evolution
- Relationship between structural dynamics and viral fitness unclear

### Prior Assumptions
- Spike protein dynamics remain constant across variants
- Mutations primarily affect binding affinity rather than overall protein dynamics
- Structural changes in variants are random rather than systematically selected

### Insight
- **Key Finding**: SARS-CoV-2 variants show progressive stabilization of spike stalk with systematic changes in dynamics
- Evolutionary pressure selects for specific dynamic properties, not just binding affinity
- Different domains (stalk vs NTD) evolve different dynamic properties serving distinct functional roles

### Technical Approach
- Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) across multiple variants
- Comprehensive analysis from ancestral to Omicron variants
- Mapping of dynamic changes onto structural domains
- Correlation of dynamics with variant emergence timeline

### Evaluation
- Systematic comparison across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants
- Quantitative measurement of conformational dynamics
- Temporal analysis correlating with viral fitness
- Validation through multiple independent measurements

### Impact
- **Validates Hypothesis 2**: Shows that controlled dynamics are evolutionarily selected and functionally important
- **Supports Hypothesis 4**: Demonstrates variant-specific changes in protein dynamics requiring adapted approaches
- **Challenges field assumptions**: Reveals systematic rather than random evolutionary changes in protein dynamics
- Establishes dynamics as key functional property beyond static structure

## Relevance to Research Hypotheses

**Directly validates Hypothesis 2**: Demonstrates that conformational dynamics are functionally important and evolutionarily selected, supporting controlled dynamics over static stabilization.

**Strongly supports Hypothesis 4**: Shows systematic variant-specific changes in spike dynamics, validating need for variant-adapted stabilization strategies.
