## Research Framework Analysis

### Problem
- Comprehensive need to understand and classify different stabilization approaches for SARS-CoV-2 spike
- Lack of systematic comparison of stabilization strategies
- Need to understand relationship between stabilization and vaccine efficacy

### Assumption in Prior Work
**Key Assumption**: That individual stabilization approaches work in isolation without comprehensive understanding of their relative merits
**Why Inadequate**: Field lacks systematic framework for comparing and optimizing different stabilization strategies

### Insight
**Novel Contribution**: Comprehensive review and classification of stabilization methods, highlighting the critical importance of structure-based approaches for vaccine development

### Technical Overview
- Systematic analysis of prefusion stabilization methods developed prior to and applied to SARS-CoV-2
- Classification of approaches:
  - Proline substitutions (2P, HexaPro)
  - Disulfide engineering
  - Cavity-filling mutations
  - Electrostatic modifications
- Comparison of stabilization effectiveness
- Analysis of structure-function relationships

### Proof/Validation
- Literature-based meta-analysis of stabilization approaches
- Structural evidence for different mechanisms
- Correlation with vaccine efficacy data where available
- Demonstration that structure-based approaches consistently outperform empirical methods

### Impact
- Established comprehensive framework for understanding stabilization strategies
- Highlighted critical importance of prefusion stabilization for vaccine success
- Influenced rational design approaches in the field
- Provided roadmap for future stabilization efforts

## Relevance to Research Hypotheses

### Supports Multi-Strategy Approach
