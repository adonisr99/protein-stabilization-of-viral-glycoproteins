## 6-Point Analysis

### Problem
- SARS-CoV-2 spike exhibits substantial conformational flexibility between closed/open states
- Difficulty in controlling specific conformational states for structural and vaccine studies
- Need tools to systematically study different spike conformations

### Prior Assumptions
- Prefusion stabilization approaches provide uniform conformational control
- Static approaches (like 2P) sufficient for maintaining desired conformations
- Individual stabilization mutations work independently

### Insight
- **Key Finding**: Precise conformational control requires understanding of allosteric networks and cooperative effects
- Different regions of spike protein communicate to control overall conformation
- Multiple stabilization approaches can be combined for enhanced control

### Technical Approach
- Systematic mutagenesis targeting different regions of spike
- Structural characterization using cryo-EM
- Conformational state analysis
- Combination of multiple stabilization strategies

### Evaluation
- Structural validation of conformational states
- Functional analysis of stabilized constructs
- Comparative analysis of different stabilization approaches

### Impact
- **Supports Hypothesis 3**: Demonstrates importance of cooperative stabilization networks
- **Challenges Assumption 4**: Shows single-target approaches insufficient for optimal control
- Provides tools for testing dynamic vs static stabilization approaches
- Establishes framework for rational conformational engineering

## Relevance to Research Hypotheses

**Directly supports Hypothesis 3**: Demonstrates the importance of understanding cooperative networks across multiple domains for achieving optimal stabilization.

**Challenges Assumption 4**: Shows that single-target approaches are insufficient for precise conformational control.
