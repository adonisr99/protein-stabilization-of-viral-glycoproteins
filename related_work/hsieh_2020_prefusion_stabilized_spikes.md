## Research Framework Analysis

### Problem
- SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exists in metastable prefusion conformation that readily converts to postfusion state
- Need stable immunogens for vaccine development that maintain prefusion conformation
- Previous approaches with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV used 2P mutations (K986P/V987P) but effectiveness on SARS-CoV-2 needed validation

### Assumption in Prior Work
**Key Assumption**: That proline substitutions (K986P/V987P) used successfully for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV would be directly transferable to SARS-CoV-2 without optimization
**Why Inadequate**: Different coronaviruses may have distinct structural characteristics requiring tailored stabilization approaches

### Insight
**Novel Contribution**: Systematic structure-based design approach that identifies the optimal combination of proline mutations and confirms their effectiveness specifically for SARS-CoV-2

### Technical Overview
- Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein prefusion conformation
- Design of HexaPro construct with 6 proline substitutions (F817P, A892P, A899P, A942P, K986P, V987P)
- Comparison with 2P (K986P/V987P) construct
- Expression and purification of stabilized constructs
- Biophysical characterization including thermal stability and negative stain electron microscopy

### Proof/Validation
- HexaPro showed significantly improved thermal stability compared to 2P
- Cryo-EM structures confirmed prefusion conformation maintenance
- Higher expression yields with HexaPro construct
- Preserved antigenicity confirmed by antibody binding studies

### Impact
- Established HexaPro as gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigen design
- Influenced multiple COVID-19 vaccine programs
- Demonstrated importance of systematic structure-based optimization beyond simple assumption transfer
- Provided framework for rational viral glycoprotein stabilization

## Relevance to Research Hypotheses

### Supports Hypothesis 1 (Cavity-Filling Alternative)
- While still using prolines, demonstrates that systematic addition of stabilizing mutations beyond the standard 2P approach yields superior results
- Shows limitation of minimal mutation approaches

### Challenges Assumption 2 (Uniform Strategies)
- Demonstrates need for virus-specific optimization rather than direct transfer of stabilization strategies

## Key Methodological Insights
- Structure-guided rational design more effective than assumption-based transfer
- Multiple mutation sites can work synergistically
- Thermal stability assays critical for characterization
- Cryo-EM validation essential for confirming conformational integrity
